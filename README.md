# url-recommendation-system

This project builds a system that can recommend relevant URLs to users based on **popularity, tags, and temporal metadata** from the Delicious dataset. The system explores three machine learning approaches:  
1. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**  
2. **Neural Networks**  
3. **LightGBM**  

This project includes **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **evaluation of model performance**.

## Repository Structure
- `1_Data/` → dataset used in this project (Delicious URLs, includes metadata like SaveCount, Tags, FirstSaveDate).
- `2_Notebook/` → Jupyter Notebook and HTML export of the code and analysis.
- `3_Report/` → project report in PDF.
